Sleeper-Rails
======
This is the Rails plugin for Sleeper - (http://sleeperapp.com). It's currently undergoing *heavy* development. It's safe for most all production sites.
You will notice it's got a bit of an identity crisis, what with being called scaler some places, and sleeper others, and sleeper-rails in still more. Mea culpa. The official name moving forward is sleeper-rails.

Quickstart
=====
- Install the Rails plugin. (script/plugin install git://github.com/adrianpike/sleeper-rails) (or: git add submodule git://github.com/adrianpike/sleeper-rails vendor/plugins/sleeper-rails)
- Run rake sleeper:install. It will prompt you for your client key from your Sleeper account, as well as some basic default functionality to use in the event that Sleeper-Rails cannot pull down a real config from your Sleeper account. It will also check for a sane environment.
- You're done!

Requirements
=====
- MySQL for explaining. Other backends work fine.
- Passenger or Mongrel for server stack.

Known Issues
=====
- Some exceptions don't bubble up to the developers' app.
- Sleeper-Rails & Masochism collide horrendously.
- Lots of room for refactoring & optimization.

TODO
=====
- Authenticate & encrypt updates.
- Better stack trace collection.
- Heroku support.
- PostgreSQL support.
- Better handling of internal exceptions.

Basic Sleeper-Rails Architecture
=====
Scaler::Configurator
- Configurator handles all the configuration for Sleeper-Rails.

Scaler::Statistics
- Store data, aggregate it, and JSON it upstream to Sleeper with some sort of hash authentication.

Scaler::Explainer
- Hack into all the AR queries, and run a WHERE for that query.
	- Store both the original query and the WHERE, as well as the line number & filename of the original query.

Scaler::Tracer
- Time all my ActionController requests - bust into the default benchmarking.
	- Send upstream total time, DB time, and view time, as well as the controller, action, and URL.
- Run a Ruby trace graph on every ActionController request, show me where I'm spending the most time.

Scaler::Walker
- Wander around a site and poke at things.

Scaler::AttributePeeker
- Fancy magic to let us know what attributes got SELECT'ed but weren't read. It doesn't work yet.

Non-automated Tools
=======

Walker:

* rake sleeper:walk host=http://localhost:3000 depth=10
